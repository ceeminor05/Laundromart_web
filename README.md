# Laundromat_web
Version control for our Laundromat website project

seek clarification for the chain of command using git but the summary follows thus:

1. clone the repository in GitHub (seek clarification if this seems unfamiliar)
2. create a local branch (seek clarification if this seems unfamiliar)
3. Pull changes from the main branch every time you want to work on your branch
4. make changes and push them to the main branch
5. await verification

Go team I guess!!
